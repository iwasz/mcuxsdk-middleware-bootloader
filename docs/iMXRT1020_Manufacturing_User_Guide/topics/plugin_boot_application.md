# Plugin boot application

The plugin boot application is usually used to enable boot features that are not natively supported by Boot ROM, for example,

-   Boot from USB disk
-   Boot from Ethernet,
-   DDR/SDRAM configuration
-   Redundant boot/reliable boot

The prototype of plugin boot application is:

bool \(\*plugin\_download\)\(void \*\*start, size\_t \*bytes, uint32\_t \*ivt\_offset\);
